PHP provides various network-related functions for working with network protocols and communication. Here's a list of some PHP network functions:

Basic Networking Functions:

fsockopen(): Open a network connection using a socket.

pfsockopen(): Open a persistent network connection using a socket.

fclose(): Close an open file pointer (which includes network connections).

feof(): Test for end-of-file on a file pointer.

fread(): Read data from an open file pointer.

fwrite(): Write data to an open file pointer.

fgets(): Read a line from an open file pointer.

fputs(): Alias of fwrite() for writing a string to a file pointer.

URL and HTTP Functions:

file_get_contents(): Reads the contents of a file into a string.

file_put_contents(): Write a string to a file.

get_headers(): Fetches the headers of an HTTP resource.

get_meta_tags(): Extracts meta tags from a URL.

parse_url(): Parses a URL and returns its components.

http_build_query(): Generate a URL-encoded query string from an array.

DNS Functions:

gethostbyname(): Get the IPv4 address of a given host.

gethostbyaddr(): Get the host name corresponding to an IPv4 address.

dns_get_record(): Get DNS resource records associated with a hostname.

Socket Functions:

socket_create(): Create a new socket resource.

socket_connect(): Initiate a connection on a socket.

socket_bind(): Bind a name to a socket.

socket_listen(): Listen for incoming connections on a socket.

socket_accept(): Accept an incoming connection on a socket.

socket_read(): Read from a socket.

socket_write(): Write to a socket.

socket_close(): Closes a socket resource.

socket_select(): Runs the select() system call on arrays of sockets.

cURL Functions:

curl_init(): Initialize a cURL session.

curl_setopt(): Set options for a cURL transfer.

curl_exec(): Execute a cURL session.

curl_getinfo(): Get information regarding a cURL transfer.

curl_close(): Close a cURL session.

curl_errno(): Return the last cURL error number.

curl_error(): Return a string containing the last cURL error.

These are some of the network-related functions in PHP, and they are used for tasks such as opening network connections, reading and writing data over the network, working with URLs, DNS, and sockets, and using the cURL library for more advanced network requests.
