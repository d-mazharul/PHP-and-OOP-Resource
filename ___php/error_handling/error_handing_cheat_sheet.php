In PHP, exception handling is an important feature for dealing with errors and exceptions that can occur during the execution of your code. Here is a list of key exception handling functions and constructs in PHP:

try...catch...finally: These are the fundamental constructs used for handling exceptions.

try: Wraps the code that may throw exceptions.
catch: Specifies the exception type(s) to catch and the code to execute when an exception is caught.
finally: Contains code that is executed whether an exception is thrown or not.
php
Copy code
try {
// Code that may throw exceptions
} catch (Exception $e) {
// Handle the exception
} finally {
// Optional: Cleanup code
}
throw: Used to manually throw an exception.

php
Copy code
throw new Exception("This is an exception message.");
Exception class: PHP provides a base Exception class, and you can create custom exception classes by extending it or using built-in exceptions like RuntimeException, InvalidArgumentException, etc.

php
Copy code
class CustomException extends Exception {
// Custom exception code
}
set_exception_handler(): Sets a user-defined function to handle uncaught exceptions.

php
Copy code
set_exception_handler(function($e) {
// Custom exception handling code
});
get_exception_handler(): Retrieves the currently set exception handler function.

restore_exception_handler(): Restores the previous exception handler.

set_error_handler(): Sets a user-defined function to handle errors (not exceptions).

php
Copy code
set_error_handler(function($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline) {
// Custom error handling code
});
error_get_last(): Retrieves information about the last error that occurred.

error_reporting(): Sets or retrieves the error reporting level.

trigger_error(): Generates a user-level error or warning.

php
Copy code
trigger_error("This is a custom error message", E_USER_WARNING);
user_error(): Alias for trigger_error().

register_shutdown_function(): Registers a function to be executed when the script finishes.

php
Copy code
register_shutdown_function(function() {
// Custom code to run on script shutdown
});
These are the core exception handling functions and constructs in PHP. Exception handling is crucial for gracefully handling errors in your code, improving code reliability, and providing meaningful error messages to users and developers. You can create custom exception classes to handle specific types of exceptions in your applications.
